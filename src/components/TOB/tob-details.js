          We are members of the Investor Compensation Scheme operated by the
          Investor Compensation Company Ltd. See below for details.
          <h6>A. Investor Compensation Scheme</h6>
          The Investor Compensation Act, 1998 provides for the establishment
          of a compensation scheme and the payment, in certain circumstances,
          of compensation to certain clients (known as eligible investors) of
          authorised investment firms, as defined in that Act.
          <br /><br />
          The Investor Compensation Company Ltd. (ICCL) was established under
          the 1998 Act to operate such a compensation scheme and our firm is a
          member of this scheme.
          <br /><br />
          Compensation may be payable where money or investment instruments
          owed or belonging to clients and held, administered or managed by
          the firm cannot be returned to those clients for the time being and
          where there is no reasonably foreseeable opportunity of the firm
          being able to do so.
          <br /><br />
          A right to compensation will arise only:
          <ul>
            <li>
              If the client is an eligible investor as defined in the Act; and
            </li>
            <li>
              If it transpires that the firm is not in a position to return
              client money or investment instruments owned or belonging to the
              clients of the firm; and
            </li>
            <li>
              To the extent that the clientâ€™s loss is recognised for the
              purposes of the Act.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          Where an entitlement to compensation is established, the
          compensation payable will be the lesser of:
          <ul>
            <li>
              90% of the amount of the clientâ€™s loss which is recognised for
              the purposes of the Investor Compensation Act, 1998; or
            </li>
            <li>Compensation of up to â‚¬20,000.</li>
          </ul>
          <br />

          We are also members of the Brokers Ireland Compensation Fund.
          Subject to the rules of the scheme the liabilities of its members
          firms up to a maximum of â‚¬100,000 per client (or â‚¬250,000 in
          aggregate) may be discharged by the fund on its behalf if the member
          firm is unable to do so, where the above detailed Investor
          Compensation Scheme has failed to adequately compensate any client
          of the member. Further details are available on request.
